In a quiet corner of the city, a garden grew wild and brilliant.
Every morning, the botanist whispered new names to the seedlings.
Time was not a line but a spiral, looping through seasons and memory.
Rain remembered the taste of old roofs and new soil.
Machines hummed lullabies for the seeds learning to dream.
Travelers carried pockets full of dawn and postcards from tomorrow.
The streets learned the patience of roots beneath the pavement.
Stories gathered like dew on the leaves of unwritten books.
The future arrived politely, asking where to put its suitcase.
Somewhere, a clock decided to blossom.
